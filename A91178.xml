            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p n="1">1 VVHether an whole well-minded and well-meaning Army, may not by ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences be abuſed to carry on the ambitious and pernitious deſignes of ſome perſons they moſt confide in, as wel as others; and be drawn on by degrees to act and demand that at laſt, which their judgements and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences at firſt abhorred, as well as <hi>Hazael,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 12, 13? And whether all who have religious and ſpecious pretences in their mouths, have the like reall intentions in their hearts and reins, which the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> proceedings in <hi>Germany</hi> diſprove, who had as holy and juſt pretences, as any now inclining to their way and opinions?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether an Army, formerly dutifull and meritorious, yet now ſo far diſtempered, as to rule (if not over-rule) their own Generall and Officers; to ſeize and remove the Kings own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, (with the Commiſſioners of both houſes appointed to attend him) from the place deſigned for his reſidence by the Parliaments of both Kingdomes (upon meer ground-leſs and proof-leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160285:3"/>
never revealed to any in Authority) without the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments privity, in high affront of their priviledges and power; endeavouring to over-awe, if not to force the Parliament which raiſed them, by marching up againſt them; labouring to diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the People, City, and Kingdome, from; and engage them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, contrary to their ſolemn Covenant; refuſing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band for the Kingdomes eaſe and peace; and acting for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by their own meer power and will; can be a probable and fitting inſtrument of redreſſing thoſe Arbitrary and injurious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the Houſes, Committees, and others, of which they now complaine? And whether their refuſal to diſ-band, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move farther off from <hi>London,</hi> or obey the Parliaments preſent juſt Commands (upon what ever ſpecious printed pretexts) be not a very ſad publike preſident, likely to conjure up a ſpirit of Univerſall Diſobedience to Parliaments, Magiſtrates, and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours of all ſorts throughout the Kingdome, to its utter ruine, if not timouſly prevented, diſ-liked, oppoſed by all well-wiſhers to the weal and tranquility of Church and State?</p>

And how their Offences can be differenced or juſtified, where their proceedings and pretences are the ſame?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether the Armies preſent disbanding now they have propoſed their grievances and demands to the Houſes, in a duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and peaceable manner upon receit of their Arrears, without marching nearer <hi>London,</hi> to eaſe the Kingdome of new taxes and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:160285:3"/>
Free quarter, to expedite the reliefe of <hi>Ireland</hi> (interrupted by their mutinie) and prevent new civill broyles, be not a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious, juſt, probable, ſafe, and honorable way to obtain all their juſt demands on their own and the Kingdomes behalfe, from both Houſes, then their refuſall to disband, or marching up to <hi>London?</hi> Which as it will ſavour of high diſobedience, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and breach of priviledge at the leaſt, if not of ſome dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſign of higher nature; ſo it will certainly endanger the adjournment or diſſolution of the Houſes, the pillaging of the City, the imbroyling of the Kingdome in a new War; blemiſh the Armies former reputation, and fidelity, encourage Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, grieve the well-affected, and procure more miſchiefes then it can redreſs; and bring* <hi>juſt damnation</hi> on the contrivers of it; who in point of conſcience <hi>ought not to do evill that good may come of it.</hi> And therefore the juſtification of their proceedings and not disbanding from the Scots (whoſe proceedings here though more dutiful and reſpectful to the Parliament then theirs, were yet much declaimed againſt by them and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) and Netherlands, who raiſed Forces, as the Parliament did now, onely in caſe of abſolute neceſſity for their own and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes neceſſary preſervation againſt their oppreſſing Princes, when there was no other remedy; is no wayes ſuitable to their or our condition, in relation to the Parliament; who need no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor externall violence (eſpecially from their own friends) to enforce them to do juſtice and redreſſe all publike grievances, which they have ſolemnly covenanted to performe and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly execute, though you disband?</p>
            <p n="5">5. What aſſurance, can the Parliament, City, or Kingdome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from a diſcontented Army, holding their guns and Weapons in their hands, if not ballanced by an equall armed force for their defence, if all their preſent demands, that are juſt &amp; reaſonable, be granted; they wil not afterwards proceed to demand that which is neither honorable, juſt, nor reaſonable for the Parliament to grant, and yet dangerous to deny, for feare of violence and new tumults, ſince their demands do dayly multiply; &amp; ſome of their Heterodox Chaplains, Officers, and Souldiers in Anti-Magiſtratical Principles, Writings, Speeches, ingender a juſt fear, of ſuch ſubſequent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, of whoſe juſtice or reaſonableneſs themſelves will be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:160285:4"/>
the Iudges, not the Parliament? And how they ſhall be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that when they have demanded and removed ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (oppoſite to them and their proceedings, perchance onely out of grounds of conſcience, which they grant muſt not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, eſpecially in Parliaments, where there ſhould be moſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome both of ſpeech and Votes) that they will not demand and remove all others who are not of their party or confederacy, and recruite the Houſe with new members of their own, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gaine a power (which ſome fear is their reall deſign) to change the Laws and Government of Church and State, and diſpoſe of all Offices and places to their own Creatures, as they have done for the moſt part in the Army? To avoyd which juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feared miſchief they have cauſe both in conſcience and honour to disband upon the Parliaments command which raiſed them. The rather, becauſe their refuſing to disband till ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and others whom they intend to impeach as incendiaries and enemies to the Army, be tried, wil be contradictory to their own principles and deſires, of <hi>free and impartial Publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;</hi> which cannot be reputed <hi>free or unbiaſſed,</hi> when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Judges ſhal be awed and terrified with an whole Army of Accuſers and proſecutors; by whoſe over-awing power, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, Menaces (the higheſt Champarty and Maintenance that can be) juſtice will probably if not certainly be perverted, the Iudges, witneſſes, and parties terrified, meer innocents condemned; and Members of the Armies party (though perhaps juſtly impeached of higher crimes and miſdemeaners then any of their oppoſites) eſcape either un-impeached or un-cenſured, contrary to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pretences.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whether the Armyes complaint of undue elections if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially examined by impartial Judges, wil not light heavieſt on their own friends and members the greateſt ſti<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lers in, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of them? Whether their general exceptions againſt elections in <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> proceeded not from their Chaplain <hi>Mr. Peters</hi> (who hath gained more by the wars then any two Presbyterian Miniſters) whoſe ſickneſs hindred his preſence at them, to bring in Members of his own party? And whether the Officers and Souldiers of the Army themſelves, have not in ſome places, deprived the people of their freedom in elections, to bring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:160285:4"/>
in themſelves, to ſtrengthen their party in the Houſe? And if ſo (as may be proved) they have moſt cauſe to complain againſt themſelves; there being no complaint or Petitions that we hear of againſt the unjuſtneſs of any Elections in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> though many againſt the Elections of divers of their party in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts; and they muſt disband their Army, that ſo all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture elections may be free as they deſire.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Whether the <hi>Independent</hi> party and ſome of the <hi>Armies</hi> friends, have not been more arbitrary, exorbitant, and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in their Votes and proceedings in the Houſes, Committees, and ſeverall Imployments; diſpoſed of and fingered more of the Kingdoms Treaſure; carryed and diſpoſed of more Offices and gainful places, received greater rewards, Salaries, and far more and better pay for the moſt part, and purſued their own ends and intereſts more then any others they aſperſe? And whether their private liſting of many thouſands to recruite the Army ſince the warrs ended without the Publick knowledg of the Houſes, to increaſe the Kingdoms charge, gives not the Parliament and others juſt occaſion, (in regard of the Armies preſent and late acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to ſuſpect the carrying on of ſome deſperate and deſtructive deſigns in England, rather then any hints or jealouſies or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther private liſtings of men without authority of Parliament, (ſuggeſted but not proved in the fourth page of the late De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.) And whether ſuch new Recruites can with equal juſtice take and Challenge Arreares, as wel as thoſe gallant Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers imployed in action all the Wars; or any of the Army challenge pay from the time they were voted to disband, for continuing together againſt the Houſes Order, and marching up againſt their Priviledges, which they were raiſed to defend?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Whether the Armies late proceedings, if not qualified by their ſpeedy disbanding and future Obedience to the Parliament; wil not eclipſe and nullifie all their former merits, glory and eſteem, in the eyes of all the world; draw perpetual ſcandal on the Profeſſion of Religion, amaze all their friends abroad and at home, endanger the loſs of dying Ireland; rejoyce the hearts, elevate the hopes and accompliſh the deſigns of our Malignant Prelatical and Romiſh Enemies; bring perpetual ſhame, if not utter ruine to our Nation; and in concluſion to the chief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:160285:5"/>
and Fomenters of them? If ſo, We confidently hope, that all Conſciencious Officers and Souldiers in the Army, upon ſecond thoughts, and ſerious peruſal of theſe Queries, wil give over their intended deſigns and diſtand, as many of them have done; and if any obſtinately perſevere to force the Parliament &amp; infringe their Priviledges, or disburb the Publick peace; that the whole Kingdom, City, and Country, according to their ſolemn Covenant, wil Unanitnouſly withſtand them, and chaſtiſe their dangerous diſobedience to the Higheſt Powers; which many fear they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to over-awe and ſubvert.</p>
